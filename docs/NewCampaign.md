Campaign Name: The Wastelands

Campaign Description: The players are in a post apocalyptic world where food and resources are scarce and there is the risk of radiation all the time. The only certain way to get nourishment is to take it from someone else. The players need to battle each other survive and get stronger.

Campaign Specific Mechanics:
1- Player damage dealt to other players each battle are recorded. If a player takes damage while it is another player's turn it is recorded as the active player damaged them.
2- Player damage dealt turns into points the players have. The points are calculated as such (Total Damage Dealt) * (Player Multiplier) * (Battle Multiplier).
    -- Player Multiplier is calculated based on the number of different players the damage has been dealt to. Single player damaged means low damage and it increases as the number of players damaged increase.
    -- Battle Multiplier increases as the battles progress. This makes sure a player cannot earn enough points in the first few battles to secure a win without even playing the final battles.
3- The players have levels and each level gained earns them different bonuses. Each battle give their creatures +1/+0. The players gain level based on their accumulated points.
4- Make the players' own levels and their total points and the current multiplier they have visible in their screen.

Campaign Structure:
- There will be 3 battles in total. They will have 6 minute timer with 30 seconds bonus every turn.
